# My First Premium Wordpress Theme

## Created in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP

# A simple WordPress theme for OxyTree trees and forestry practices, etc. 
<br>
This is my first fully editable theme from the WordPress admin panel.
<br> 
I first created the HTML/CSS and JS template, and then focused on adding functionality for WordPress.
<br>
Editable elements from the admin panel include: 
<br>
-Website logo, <br>
-Navigation, <br>
-Category list, <br>
-Articles entries displayed dynamically (without adding pagination), <br>
-"About Me" section (title, brief description, administrator photos and their signatures) <br>
-Footer navigation menu. (Default URLs from navigation links lead to "#"). <br>
The graphics on the website were taken from the following pages:<br>
- https://www.flaticon.com/ <br>
- https://unsplash.com/ <br>

## This theme was created solely for exercise purposes and should not be used for commercial purposes.
