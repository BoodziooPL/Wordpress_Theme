# My First Premium Wordpress Theme

## Created in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP

### A simple WordPress theme for OxyTree trees and forestry practices, etc. 
This is my first fully editable theme from the WordPress admin panel. 
I first created the HTML/CSS and JS template, and then focused on adding functionality for WordPress.
Editable elements from the admin panel include: 
-Website logo, 
-Navigation, 
-Category list, 
-Articles entries displayed dynamically (without adding pagination), 
-"About Me" section (title, brief description, administrator photos and their signatures) 
-Footer navigation menu. (Default URLs from navigation links lead to "#"). 
The graphics on the website were taken from the following pages:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://unsplash.com/
##### This theme was created solely for exercise purposes and should not be used for commercial purposes.
